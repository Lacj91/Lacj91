### Hello everyone! ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Lacj91/Lacj91** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning news skills & trying my best to contribute more to society.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning German, Coding, Swimming (beginner) & how to control emotions (others and mine)
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on something that make people happy (and of course me).
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anything i should know about coding. Im a total beginner, so everything is welcome :).
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Anything. I always happy to help and talk about my thoughts and how can i help or be helped. Is something bothers me, i will let know without problems.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to collect figures of Saint Seiya (caballeros del Zodiaco), specially Myth Cloths & Demon Slayer :). My favorite character from Mario Bros is Peach, because she is the best :D
